### Sunsynk Ecco 3.6kW Hybrid Inverter
Model number: `SUN-3.6K-SG04LP1-EU`

This likely applies to similar models in the Ecco range: `SUN-3K-SG04LP1-24-EU / SUN-3K-SG04LP1-EU / SUN-5K-SG04LP1-EU / SUN-6K-SG04LP1-EU`

The Ecco inverters have a combined RS485 and CAN-BUS port. If your battery is already using the port for its CAN-BUS communications, an RJ45 splitter is required to separate the communications between RS485 and CAN-BUS.
[SolarAssistant have a helpful page](https://solar-assistant.io/help/deye/2_in_1_bms_port) that explains the wiring of the port and the splitter required.
