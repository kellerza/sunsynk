# Sensors

You can add sensors under the `SENSORS` and `SENSORS_FIRST_INVERTER` keys in the configuration.

If you want to add the *Battery SOC* sensor, you can use any of the following formats. In the logs you will see the first format (no spaces and all lower case).

```yaml
SENSORS:
  - battery_soc
  - Battery SOC
  - battery_SOC
```

This page lists common sensors that can also be added through sensor groups. You can find all the supported sensor names in the sensor definition files, or even use the Modbus protocol document to create your own definitions.

## Sensor definitions

The sensor definitions include the modbus register number (or several registers), the name of the sensor, the unit and other optional parameters. For example:

```python
Sensor(183, "Battery voltage", VOLT, 0.01),
Sensor(184, "Battery SOC", "%"),
```

The last parameter in the battery voltage sensor definition is a factor, in this case a value of 1 in the register represents 0.01V. When the factor is negative for normal sensors it indicates that the number in the register is Signed (it can be negative & positive)

To enable both these sensors in your configuration, simply use the names:

```yaml
SENSORS:
  - battery_voltage
  - battery_soc
```

## Single Phase Inverter Sensor Definitions

You can find all the definitions here: <https://github.com/kellerza/sunsynk/blob/main/src/sunsynk/definitions.py>

These definitions are used when you configure a single-phase inverter in the addon:

```yaml
SENSOR_DEFINITIONS: single-phase
```

## Three Phase Inverter Sensor Definitions

You can find all the definitions here: <https://github.com/kellerza/sunsynk/blob/main/src/sunsynk/definitions3ph.py>

These definitions are used when you configure a three-phase inverter in the addon:

```yaml
SENSOR_DEFINITIONS: three-phase
```

## Three Phase High Voltage Inverter Sensor Definitions

You can find all the definitions here: <https://github.com/kellerza/sunsynk/blob/main/src/sunsynk/definitions3phhv.py>

These definitions are used when you configure a three-phase inverter in the addon:

```yaml
SENSOR_DEFINITIONS: three-phase-hv
```

## Groups of sensors

Sensor groups will allow you to add several sensors with a single entry.

### Energy management

These sensors are mostly related to energy or kWh and required for the Home Assistant [Energy Management](../guide/energy-management)

```yaml
SENSORS:
  - energy_management
```
