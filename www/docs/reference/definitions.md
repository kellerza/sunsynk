# Sensors

::: tip
You can find all sensors names in the definitions here: <https://github.com/kellerza/sunsynk/blob/main/src/sunsynk/definitions>
:::

You can add sensors under the `SENSORS` and `SENSORS_FIRST_INVERTER` keys in the configuration.

If you want to add the *Battery SOC* sensor, you can use any of the following formats. In the logs you will see the first format (no spaces and all lower case).

```yaml
SENSORS:
  - battery_soc
  - Battery SOC
  - battery_SOC
```

This page lists common sensors that can also be added through sensor groups. You can find all the supported sensor names in the sensor definition files, or even use the Modbus protocol document to create your own definitions.

## Sensor definitions

The sensor definitions include the modbus register number (or several registers), the name of the sensor, the unit and other optional parameters. For example:

```python
Sensor(183, "Battery voltage", VOLT, 0.01),
Sensor(184, "Battery SOC", "%"),
```

The last parameter in the battery voltage sensor definition is a factor, in this case a value of 1 in the register represents 0.01V. When the factor is negative for normal sensors it indicates that the number in the register is Signed (it can be negative & positive)

To enable both these sensors in your configuration, simply use the names:

```yaml
SENSORS:
  - battery_voltage
  - battery_soc
```

You can find the details of the definitions [on Github](https://github.com/kellerza/sunsynk/blob/main/src/sunsynk/definitions) and definitions are selected in the configuration with one of the following options:

```yaml
SENSOR_DEFINITIONS: single-phase / three-phase [low voltage] / three-phase-hv [high voltage]
```

## Groups of sensors

Sensor groups will allow you to add several sensors with a single entry.

### All sensors

The **all** group will include all the sensors available for your inverter.

```yaml
SENSORS:
  - all
```

Adding all sensors will cause Home Assistant to record a great amount of data, that you might not need. This could lead to a large database and slow down your system. It is especially bad if you are using an SD card for your Home Assistant installation.

Rather consider using the other groups or selecting the sensors you need.

::: warning
It is *not* recommended to add **all** sensors for your final system. This is mainly for testing purposes.
