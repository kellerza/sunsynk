# Configuration

## Driver

The `DRIVER` can be **umodbus** or **pymodbus** or **solarman**.

The `READ_SENSOR_BATCH_SIZE` option allows you to customize how many registers may be read in a single request. Devices like the USR only allows 8 registers to be read. When using mbusd this can be much higher.

The `READ_ALLOW_GAP` option allows you to set the amount of gap between requested registers. In some cases it makes more sense to read a couple of additional registers in 1 or two requests, than trying to read exactly what you are looking for in multiple requests.

## Inverters

The `INVERTERS` option contains a list of inverters

The following options are required per inverter:

- `SERIAL_NR`

  The serial number of your inverter. When you start the add-on the connected serial will be displayed in the log.

  The add-on will not run if the expected/configured serial number is not found.

  ::: tip

  This must be a string. So if your serial is a number only surround it with quotes `'1000'`

  :::

- `HA_PREFIX`

  A prefix to add to all the MQTT Discovered Home Assistant Sensors (default: SS).

- `MODBUS_ID`

  The Modbus Server ID is a number typically 1. Might be different in multi-inverter setups.

- `DONGLE_SERIAL_NUMBER`

  Only required for the **solarman** driver.

- `PORT`

  The port used for communications. Format depends on the driver. See [Port](#port)

### Port

The port for RS485 communications, which can be either:

- A `tcp://` port toward a Modbus TCP gateway. Either mbusd or one of the hardware options

  ```yaml
  INVERTERS:
    - PORT: tcp://homeassistant.local:502
  ```

  A `serial-tcp://` port is also suported and can be used depending on your gateway.

  ::: tip
  This repository contains a [mbusd](../guide/mbusd) TCP gateway add-on that can be used for this purpose.

  If you have any issues connecting directly to a serial port, please try mbusd - also see [this](https://github.com/kellerza/sunsynk/issues/131) issue

  ::: details Solarman driver details

  The Solarman driver typically uses `tcp://`, with a port value of 8899. You will need to find the dongle's local IP on your network. You can find the IP on your router, or use a utility like [netscan](https://www.portablefreeware.com/?id=730).

  You probably want to set a fixed IP for the dongle on your router.

  ```yaml
  DRIVER: solarman
  INVERTER:
    - PORT: tcp://192.168.1.182:8899
  ```

  Refer to the [Schedules](./schedules) section for recommended schedule overrides.

  :::

- A serial port. List of available ports under _Supervisor_ -> _System_ tab -> _Host_ card **&vellip;** -> _Hardware_ (You can also use the text in the DEBUG_PORT as reference)

  ```yaml
  DRIVER: pymodbus
  INVERTERS:
    - PORT: /dev/ttyUSB0
  ```

  ::: tip
  umodbus requires a `serial://` prefix

  ```yaml
  DRIVER: umodbus
  INVERTERS:
    - PORT: serial:///dev/ttyUSB0
  ```

    :::

- For the first inverter in the list, you can use an empty string

  ```yaml
  INVERTERS:
    - PORT: ""
  ```

  The serial port under `DEBUG_DEVICE` will be used (located at the bottom of you config)*

- umodbus support an RFC2217 compatible port (e.g. `tcp://homeassistant.local:6610`)

## Sensors

The `SENSOR_DEFINITION` option allows you to select between `single-phase`, `three-phase` and `three-phase-hv` sensor definitions.

The `SENSORS` accepts a list of sensors to poll. Refer to the [single](./definitions) and [three](./definitions3ph) docs

The `SENSORS_FIRST_INVERTER` accepts a list of sensors that will only be applied to the first inverter

## Schedules

Refer to [Schedules](./schedules)

## Home Assistant Discovery options

The per-inverter `HA_PREFIX` will be used for the Device (the Inverter) name and the prefix to all the entity Ids in Home Assistant

The `MANUFACTURER` option allows you to rename the inverter manufacturer that will be displayed on the Home Assistant device. It does not have to be Sunsynk ;-)

The `NUMBER_ENTITY_MODE` option allows you to change how read/write sensors which present as number entities in Home Assistant behave.
The default display mode is `auto`. This setting controls how the number entity should be displayed in the UI. Can be set to `box` or `slider` to force a display mode.

## MQTT Settings

You will need a working MQTT server since all values will be sent via MQTT toward Home
Assistant.

The default configuration assumes the Mosquitto broker add-on and you simply have to
fill in your password.

```yaml
MQTT_HOST: core-mosquitto
MQTT_PORT: 1883
MQTT_USERNAME: hass
MQTT_PASSWORD: my-secure-password
```

## Debug options

- `DEBUG`

  The values received will continuously be printed to the add-on's log. This will confirm
  that you receive values.

  | Value | Description                  |
  | ----- | ---------------------------- |
  | `0`   | No debug messages.           |
  | `1`   | Messages for filter changes. |
  | `2`   | Debug level logging.         |

- `DEBUG_DEVICE` allows you to select the USB port in the UI. It will only be used if `PORT` is empty. But you have to select something.
